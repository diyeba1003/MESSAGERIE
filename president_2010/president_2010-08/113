SPECIAL REPORT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

=93Never before have there been so many social scientists in the world =96 =
many
more than the 200,000 population of Margaret Mead=92s famous Samoa. Never
before have the social sciences been so influential,=94 writes Gudmund
Hernes, President of the International Social Science Council, in the
preface to the World Social Science Report 2010: Knowledge divides.
Published by Unesco, the 400-page report has 10 chapters covering a wide
range of issues confronting the social sciences and their role in countries
across all continents.

In a foreword Irina Bokova, Unesco Director-General, says the report is
the first =93thorough overview of this important field in more than a decad=
e=94
and is the result of the work of hundreds of professional social
scientists. Bokova says Unesco, =93with its emphasis on the management of
social transformation=94, is concerned that the social sciences should be p=
ut
to use to improve human well-being and to respond to global challenges.

The following articles by GEOFF MASLEN are drawn from various chapters in
the report.

GLOBAL: Worlds apart but on same map?

In spite of the impact social scientists have had around the world, Gudmund
Hernes says humans face crises that tax their understanding and their
capacity to cope. The President of the International Social Science Council
describes the influence of social science as a =93mixed blessing=94 and says
social scientists=92 foresight has been poor at key junctures in recent
times.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: Social sciences brain drain or gain?

Social scientists migrate from the main academic centres to the periphery
to teach, export their skills or do research and gather data. In the
opposite direction, talented young social scientists tend to leave a
peripheral position to go to academic centres to be trained or work with
the most eminent scholars, says Laurent Jeanpierre, a professor of
political science at the University of Paris-8 Saint-Denis.

ASIA-PACIFIC: Social science transcends boundaries

employment, social mobility and equity, security and safety, education,

governance required to manage these matters.=20

ARAB REGION: Academic freedom curtailed

The social sciences in the Arab region are shaped by severe
socio-political, economic and environmental challenges, instability and by
diverse and divergent research policies, agendas and funding programmes at
the national and regional levels, say Seteney Shami and Moushira Elgeziri.

AFRICA: Social science under-resourced but resilient

AFRICA: Charting the decline of social sciences

The all-round expansion that characterised African higher education in
general, and the social sciences in particular, during the 1960s was
interrupted at the end of the 1970s as African countries began to slide
into a prolonged economic crisis, says Dr Adebayo Olukoshi, Director of the
UN African Institute for Economic Development and Planning.=20

KENYA: Why academics do not publish

resources and capacity in higher education, say the editors of the World
Social Science Report 2010 in a discussion of why Kenyan academics do not
publish in international refereed journals.

NORTH AMERICA: Social research too inward-looking

The most distinctive feature of North American social science, besides its
size, is the extent of the investment made in time, facilities, training
and incentives for research since the Second World War, says Craig Calhoun,
President of the US Social Science Research Council and a social sciences
professor at New York University.=20

LATIN AMERICA: Rise of the social sciences

Universities are crucial actors in the evolution of the social sciences in
Latin America, say Hebe Vessuri, head of the Venezuelan Institute of
Scientific Research=92s Center on Science Studies, and Maria Sonsir=E9 L=F3=
pez
who also works at the centre in Caracas. This can only be understood by
taking into account the changing relationship between public universities
and the state, and the conflicts and social movements involving
universities.

GLOBAL: Social science and rankings

The number of social science publications in international journals is much
lower than those for the natural sciences and medicine. So the natural
sciences and the medical fields dominate university rankings while the
strength of universities=92 social sciences scarcely contributes to their
position, says Anthony FJ van Raan, a professor of science studies and
Director of the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden
University.

UK: Challenging ruling mantras of higher education

John Higgins*
There is a special kind of British humour that is very good at locating
the absurd in everyday life. It draws our attention to much of what we take
for granted just by tone of voice or the raising of an eyebrow. Either of
these can be enough to effectively place scare quotes around a clich=E9; or
draw our critical attention to something, and make us laugh at the sudden
absurdity of what once seemed authoritative.=20=20=20
