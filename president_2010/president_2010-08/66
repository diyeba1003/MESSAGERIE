"Rankings and internationalisation" announcement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the release of Shanghai=92s 2010 Academic Ranking of World
Universities, University World News this week publishes two rankings
commentaries. John O=92Leary, an editor of The Times Good University Guide
and executive advisory board member of QS World University Ranking, writes
that British and American students squeezed out of universities may start
looking overseas for study =96 and that QS=92 ranking, which captures the v=
iews
of employers, is the one that matters for students. Richard Holmes, author
of the University Ranking Watch blog, charts a decline in the dominance of
universities from the West and Japan and states that the methodological
stability of the Shanghai ranking makes it the most reliable for monitoring
changes in the world of scientific research. In a related article,
professors of higher education Philip G Altbach and Anthony Welch argue
that under-funding of higher education and the money-making goal of
internationalisation in Australia have undermined the strong reputation of
its universities.

David Jobbins

crisis did not change universities=92 responsibility to use resources

EGYPT: Universities to scrap textbooks and go digital

Ashraf Khaled
To many academics and students in Egypt, Minister of Higher Education Hani
Hilal is the minister of controversy. Months ago, citing security concerns,
he banned female students wearing the niqab (full-face veil) from staying
in low-cost dormitories or sitting exams. He triggered another uproar when
he decided not to build new law schools, saying that the country already
had sufficient. His latest controversial decision is to ban the use of
textbooks.

Yojana Sharma
After censoring the news media and internet in the wake of the May
crackdown, the Thai government has turned its sights on campus plays for
signs of political dissent. Seemingly innocuous and entertaining amateur
dramatics by students have come under scrutiny by the nervous authorities,
who fear they may contain seditious ideas or affect national security.

UK: Record scramble for university places

Diane Spencer
As A-level exam results were announced last Thursday, it was predicted
that some 200,000 young people might fail to get into a UK university out
of the record number of 660,000 who applied this year. UCAS, the university
and college admissions service, calculated that 44% failed to get the
grades they needed, but 380,000 had achieved their desired places.=20

INDIA-UK: New student visa requirements restrictive

Alya Mishra
Although Britain this month ended a six-month suspension of issuing
student visas in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, it has tightened student visa
rules to include new language requirements. Many overseas students say this

elsewhere for their studies.

COMMENTARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: University rankings =96 It=92s about jobs, stupid!

John O=92Leary*
International study has been one of the global phenomena of the current
millennium. The numbers going abroad to university have jumped from fewer
than two million in 2000 to more than three million this year. Until now,
most of the traffic has been from Asia to Western universities, but there
may be a new direction of travel this year, as students squeezed out of
British and American universities look overseas in much larger numbers.

GLOBAL: Shanghai rankings: Shifting research landscape

Richard Holmes*
In recent years, something like a small-scale industry has developed with
commentators earnestly trying to read long-term trends into the rise and
fall of various universities in the former THE-QS rankings. Such efforts
have been largely futile.

AUSTRALIA: The perils of commerc ialism

Philip G Altbach and Anthony Welch*
More than two decades ago, the Australian government decided that
international higher education should become an industry; since then it has
become a major income producer for the nation. The higher education sector
was motivated to make money from international education by government
budget cuts, with revenue to be made up largely by entrepreneurial
international activity.

ETHIOPIA: Expanding and improving higher education

Kate Ashcroft*
Ethiopia is radically expanding its higher education sector: from two
federal universities to 22 in just over a decade and another 10 to open
soon. Even so, the percentage of the available cohort that attends higher
education is still low at about 3%, compared with a Sub-Saharan average in
2007 of 6%, according to Unesco. The huge expansion of student numbers is
mainly in new regional universities and a vibrant private system.
