INDIA: World=92s oldest university is reborn after 800 years

During the six centuries of its storied existence, there was nothing else
quite like Nalanda University, writes Andrew Buncombe for The Independent.
Probably the first-ever large educational establishment, the college =96 in
what is now eastern India =96 even counted the Buddha among its visitors and
alumni. At its height, it had 10,000 students, 2,000 staff and striving for
both understanding and academic excellence. Today, this much-celebrated
centre of Buddhist learning is in ruins.

BRAZIL: University affirmative action faces crucial rests

When Rio de Janeiro became the first Brazilian state to adopt quotas for
Afro-Brazilian students in institutions of higher education in 2002, black
activists hoped that the country was finally coming to terms with the
bitter legacy of slavery, write Andrew Downie and Marion Lloyd for The
Chronicle of Higher Education. But eight years later affirmative action
policies, which have since been adopted by scores of other universities on
behalf of the country=92s most disadvantaged groups, could be ruled
unconstitutional by the Federal Supreme Court.
