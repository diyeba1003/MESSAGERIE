This week=92s highlights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

University World News celebrated its third anniversary last week. We take
readers behind the news to tell the story of how it all began, how the
newspaper has grown and what it is today. Prominent figures in higher
education across the world took the time to comment on our weekly
international publication. The anniversary is also marked with a bumper
edition.

There are loads of breaking stories and we introduce a new section,
Student View. In the first column HUMA MOHYUDDIN explains why she supports
the freedom of Muslim students to wear the veil. In Features JAN PETTER
MYKLEBUST looks at Europe=92s new innovation agenda while SARAH KING HEAD
describes capacity-building partnerships between universities in the US and
Africa. From South Africa, SHARON DELL reports on proposals to boost the
number of PhDs and CRAIN SOUDIEN explores where responsibility lies for
racism in universities. Wrapping it all up, GEOFF MASLEN writes about
ground-breaking research by a masters student in Melbourne into plumage
patterns and the mating of birds.

GLOBAL: The University World News story
Karen MacGregor
Every newspaper has its own story and ours began in early 2007, when a few
dozen higher education correspondents scattered around the world found
themselves with knowledge and skills but no newspaper to write for. Mostly
freelance journalists, we had been fired en masse by Times Higher Education
as it contracted its global coverage, retaining correspondents only in the
US and Brussels.
http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=3D20101017173205137

I am glad to see the efforts by University World News to monitor global
higher education developments worldwide. I am specifically pleased to see
that you do so for Saudi Arabia and its higher education revolution. As we
learn from other countries=92 experiences, we are pleased that other
countries are learning from ours. UWN is a powerful platform to share such
experiences. I find it very interesting and educating. Keep up the good
work.
Abdulkader Alfantookh
Professor and Deputy Minister of Higher Education for Planning and
Information
Ministry of Higher Education, Saudi Arabia

University World News is an invaluable source of independent information
and comment on universities worldwide.
Professor W John Morgan
Unesco Chair of the Political Economy of Education, University of
Nottingham
Chairman of the UK National Commission for Unesco

University World News fills a major gap in knowledge. It provides
up-to-date, truly global and in-depth coverage of developments in higher
education. It is not subject to sensationalism nor to parochialism, as
besets so much in the mainstream media. Instead, it has clear and
constructive editorial standards that ensure it provides in one place so
much that is worth knowing about the modern university and the policies and
activities affecting higher education. University World News has become
indispensable reading for all who value systematic insight into the role
and contribution of universities.
Dr Glenn Withers
Chief Executive, Universities Australia

There is only one web news source that provides a truly global picture of
the fast moving policy world of higher education, and that is University
World News. I reference it often, and encourage others to do the same =96
particularly my American colleagues who need the reference point of the
pursuits of other nations and economic competitors.
John Aubrey Douglass
Senior Research Fellow, Center for Studies in Higher Education
University of California =96 Berkeley

University World News is an invaluable up-to-date resource on current
issues internationally in higher education. It provides those of us
interested in keeping abreast with developments in the field with
researched information. The Africa Edition is an added bonus we all need
for information on developments on the continent. It helps keep African
academics in the diaspora connected to the debates on higher education in
Africa.
Teboho Moja
Professor of Higher Education, New York University.
Former adviser to the Minister of Education in South Africa.

 University World News is a trusted source of information on higher
education issues around the globe. Congratulations to UWN on three years of
quality reporting.
Paul Davidson
President of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada

University World News has become the most important single source of
information about global higher education. Its editors and reporters do a
superb job. We have quickly come to take for granted the sharp reporting,
reports and documents in depth, and the remarkable coverage across all
higher education systems. Congratulations UWN =96 and don=92t stop doing wh=
at
you do!

Professor of Higher Education, Centre for the Study of Higher Education

IRELAND: European Commission angry over cut awards

John Walshe
The Irish Government is in danger of losing up to =8010m (US$14 million) a
year in EU funding because it imposed pay cuts on leading university
researchers who are funded entirely by Brussels. Around 70 Marie Curie
scholars, mostly from overseas, have had their awards reduced in line with
cuts in salaries throughout the Irish public service. But the decision has
angered the European Commission, which has accused the government of breach
of contract.
