This week=92s highlights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Commentary, LUCY JAMES argues that universities must support students to
challenge extreme Islamist ideologies on campus in order to protect freedom
of speech; WIN MIN says if the Burmese election on November is rigged,
there will be no protests this time because the student movement has been
elaborately silenced; and JOEL DUFFY says cash-strapped universities should
not be using public money to pay private lobbyists to put their case to
government. In Features, KENCHO WANGDI, tracks the Himalayan kingdom of
Bhutan=92s attempts to become a higher education hub. And in Business, GEOFF
MASLEN reports on the pitfalls for negotiators of misunderstanding cultural
differences in body language.

UK: Massive cuts raise spectre of student outflux

Diane Spencer and Brendan O=92Malley
The coalition government is cutting the higher education budget by 40%.
The budget will be reduced from =A37.1 billion to =A34.2 billion (US$11.2
billion to US$6.6 billion) by 2014-15. The scale of the cuts, and the
possibility of tuition fees being driven up to compensate if the fee cap
for UK students is raised, have left some European university leaders
rubbing their hands with glee at the heightened prospect of enticing UK
students abroad.

EUROPE: Universities agree PhD reform principles

Brendan O=92Malley and Cayley Dobie
Higher education institutions must develop a critical mass and diversity

for doctoral candidates, the European Association of Universities (EUA)
warned this week.

AUSTRALIA: Saving cancer patients from starvation

Geoff Maslen
It is like watching someone starve to death: sometimes slowly, sometimes
so quickly as to be shocking in its suddenness but always dreadfully
painful to the sufferers and their relatives. Half the people dying with
cancer lose weight and their muscles waste away until a significant
proportion of their body mass has gone. This is the impact of a condition
called cancer cachexia, from the Greek meaning =91bad condition=92.
