SPECIAL EDITION: OECD HIGHER EDUCATION CONFERENCE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The biennial conference of the Institutional Management in Higher Education
programme of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) took place in Paris from 13-15 September 2010. Entitled Higher
Education in a World Changed Utterly: Doing more with less, the signature
gathering investigated how, in the context of a global recession, higher
education can lead the way to sustainable recovery.=20

There were more than 30 plenary speakers and some 60 presenters in
parallel sessions. Discussions ranged across a wide variety of issues, from
challenges facing higher education and how tertiary institutions and
systems have responded to funding cuts to links between academia and
industry, the use of technology and social engagement. Reflecting on the
conference, its organiser Richard Yelland described a mood of
=93self-criticism, an acceptance that despite reform little fundamental
change had been made, and that the university model =96 driven by aspiration
to climb up the higher education value chain and amplified by rankings =96
was still undervaluing higher level vocational education and open and
distance learning=94.

University World News  was a media partner to the conference, and a team
of five journalists reported on it, led by Asia Editor Yojana Sharma. Live
coverage was provided, a selection of articles were published afterwards,
and this weekend=92s Special Edition of the newspaper is devoted entirely to
the OECD conference. Full details are available on the
http://www.oecd.org/edu/imhe/generalconference.

GLOBAL: The train on platform 2010 is about to leave

Yojana Sharma
Nearly 470 people from 62 countries made the OECD=92s Institutional
Management for Higher Education general conference this year its biggest
ever. There was a strong turnout from Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US, while Latin America
was also well represented, particularly Mexico and Brazil.=20

GLOBAL: Hot higher education issues

The global financial crisis means that higher education institutions =93need
to work smarter=94, said OECD Director for Education Barbara Ischinger,
kicking off the three-day Institutional Management in Higher Education
conference on 13 September. =93We need to ensure institutions play to their
strengths.=94 While the recession has affected public investment in
universities, student demand for higher education has never been stronger.

THE BIG ISSUES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: Never mind quality, as universities expand

Yojana Sharma
The OECD=92s general conference, Higher Education in a World Changed
Utterly: Doing more with less, identified one of the great challenges of
expanding university systems: can higher education provide value while
admitting more students and cutting back on spending in a recessionary
climate? The problem is that no one knows how to measure the =91value=92 of
higher education.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: The crisis, business and higher education

Lawrence J Speer
Joe Astroth wants to be a change agent. As chief education officer of
US-based high-tech giant Autodesk, Astroth is playing a leading role in the
company=92s continuing bid to create stronger links between industry and
academia. It is a role he relishes. The global recession, Astroth said, has
changed the environment facing businesses and universities alike. =93The
economic crisis has brought us together in an accelerated manner,=94 he told
University World News at the 2010 OECD higher education conference in
Paris.

EUROPE: Students face =91new and sad reality=92

Patricia Brett
Today=92s students do not want to =93go down in history as the first
generation of modern Europe that can expect to =91benefit=92 from fewer
opportunities than the previous one,=94 Bert Vandenkendelaere, chair of the
European Students=92 Union, told the OECD higher education conference in
Paris. Threatened by significant age wage gaps, high dropout rates, rampant
graduate unemployment and limited support in starting a home or family,
students fear their future may be bleaker than that of their parents.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: Technology and innovation in higher education

Patricia Brett
Innovative solutions are required to mitigate the budget cuts brought on
by the current financial crisis, but innovation is not always synonymous
with hi-tech, speakers told the OECD=92s 2010 higher education conference in
Paris last month. The need to redress the bias of research to the detriment
of teaching was a recurring theme, as was a call for greater social
responsibility in producing well-informed, responsible citizens.=20=20

DOING MORE WITH LESS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: Push towards innovative funding methods

Lawrence J Speer
Shrinking state budgets and financial shortfalls linked to the global
recession are forcing universities to devise new means of raising revenue,
notably through increased interaction with the private sector, according to
participants at last month=92s OECD higher education conference in Paris. T=
he
accelerating push towards public-private partnerships and other innovative
funding methods was one of the gathering=92s principal themes.

US: Huge university =91doing more with less=92 =96 Reed

Alecia D McKenzie
When you meet California State University Chancellor Charles B Reed for
the first time, you think you=92ve met him before. It takes a few minutes to
realise that Reed bears a striking resemblance to English actor Bob
Hoskins. He has the same round appearance, direct gaze and pugilistic
stance, as if he=92s ready to do battle. And it has been a battle over the
past two years, as Reed has slashed costs at the university and deflected
criticism and outcry as he tried to absorb a US$600 million blow in the
form of state budget cuts.

UK: Run universities like supermarkets =96 consultant

Lawrence J Speer
A senior manager with the London-based strategy and insight consultancy
SHM has suggested universities and other higher education institutions be
run like supermarkets. Paul Gillooly presented this provocative idea to an
incredulous group of government officials and university leaders at the
OECD=92s Institutional Management in Higher Education general conference in
Paris in September.

COUNTRY CASES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICELAND-IRELAND: Universities merge post-bubble

Yojana Sharma
Universities in Iceland and Ireland expanded dramatically during the 1990s
boom, in part to promote regional development and absorb more students. But
when the economic bubble burst, experts recommended a reduction in the
overall number of institutions through painful mergers, as Denmark had
already done.

at the OECD=92s Institutional Management in Higher Education conference held
in Paris in September.

BAHAMAS: Development role for small island universities

Alecia D McKenzie
Small island states, which are increasingly vulnerable to global problems,
need to have their universities play a stronger role in national
development. =93A small island nation has limited tools for driving its own
development,=94 said Janyne Hodder, former president of the College of the
Bahamas and an administrative board member of the International Association
of Universities, at the OECD=92s 2010 higher education conference.

ISRAEL: Innovation lacking in universities

Lawrence J Speer
Israel may have transformed itself over the past decade into one of the

or
of the research authority at the Open University of Israel and CEO of OPMOP
Ltd Technology Transfer Company.

JAPAN: Private spending on higher education rising

Suvendrini Kakuchi
Private spending on university education in Japan is high at 67.5%,
according to a recent report released by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development on public education investment in 28 member
states. The OECD=92s Education at a Glance 2010 report indicated that the
average for all nations was 30.9%, illustrating that in Japan private
spending on higher education plays a vital role in supplementing low public
funding.

SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT

GLOBAL: Benefits (and costs) of social engagement

Alecia D McKenzie
As universities face increasing budget cuts and see their ivory-tower
image attacked, many now espouse increased involvement in community and
global issues. But although this =91social engagement=92 drive has numerous
supporters, others wonder at the cost and the long-term impact on
universities, especially in the area of research.

CONTEXT AND CONCLUSIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: How higher education can help recovery

Mary-Louise Kearney and Richard Yelland*
Against the background of the most synchronised recession in developed
countries in over half a century, the OECD=92s Institutional Management in
Higher Education 2010 general conference focused on how the higher
education sector =96 governments, institutions and individuals =96 can help
contribute to sustainable recovery. Capitalising on the OECD=92s respected
evidence base and drawing on analyses and opinions from some of the world=
=92s
leading experts, the conference tried to identify ways to achieve higher
quality outcomes at a time of increased demand and fewer resources, and
examined innovative approaches to meeting the challenges of equity and
efficiency.

UK: Austerity challenging the values of universities

Karen MacGregor
Never before have universities faced such remarkable challenges to their
fundamental values, said Professor Malcolm Grant, President and Provost of
University College London, at the OECD higher education conference last
month. During this time of austerity universities must continue to hold
true to their values and take a long-term view, positioning themselves for
10 years=92 time =93against the short-term turbulence of immediate change=
=94.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: The big challenges for higher education=20

Karen MacGregor
The mood at the 2010 OECD higher education conference was more
self-critical than complaining, according to Richard Yelland, head of the
Education Management and Infrastructure Division in the organisation=92s
Education Directorate. =93Notwithstanding their good intentions, institutio=
ns
and systems are not fulfilling their social responsibilities =96 to nurture
research which will address pressing global issues, and equitable access to
teaching which is relevant to the labour market and to society,=94 he told
University World News.

COMMENTARY: A view from the periphery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OECD: Conference shies away from long-term solutions

Tunde Fatunde
Many of the solutions proposed by participants in the OECD=92s Institutional
Management in Higher Education conference were short term, palliative
measures when the deepest crisis in higher education funding since the
Second World War means the sector is in need of a kind of Marshall Plan to
save it.

on, higher education can lead the way to sustainable recovery. <BR>
<BR>
There were more than 30 plenary speakers and some 60 presenters in parallel=
 sessions. Discussions ranged across a wide variety of issues, from challen=
ges facing higher education and how tertiary institutions and systems have =
responded to funding cuts to links between academia and industry, the use o=
f technology and social engagement. Reflecting on the conference, its organ=
iser Richard Yelland described a mood of =93self-criticism, an acceptance t=
hat despite reform little fundamental change had been made, and that the un=
iversity model =96 driven by aspiration to climb up the higher education va=
lue chain and amplified by rankings =96 was still undervaluing higher level=
 vocational education and open and distance learning=94.<BR>
<BR>
<I>University World News </I> was a media partner to the conference, and a =
team of five journalists reported on it, led by Asia Editor Yojana Sharma. =
