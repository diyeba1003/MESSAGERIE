This week=92s highlights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a Special Report for this year=92s final edition, edited by PHILIP FINE,
we look back at higher education in 2010, including how the sector was
covered in the pages of University World News. In Features LILY PHILLIPOSE
reports on a new myth-busting study of private universities in Germany, and
MIKE IVES writes that China=92s ethnic minorities education policy is not
working optimally, prompting some to call for a reassessment. In Commentary
MARTIN INCE, chair of the academic advisory board of the QS World
University Rankings, argues that while rankings are useful to students,
academics, institutions and governments, none of them can tell you all you
need to know about a complex body like a university. And NALAKA GUNAWARDENE
writes that ideologically-driven bickering between higher education
stakeholders in Sri Lanka is holding up much-needed reform.

less than those in Australia =96 the top-ranked country when cost of living

SPECIAL REPORT: Higher education in 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: 2010 =96 A year of shortages and partnerships

The UK=92s tripling of a tuition fee cap made a significant impact globally
in 2010, especially in light of the world now having to deal with the bill
for all those stimulus injections by so many governments. Where there are
funding shortfall stories, there can usually be found stories on how some
countries try to make up for the lack of funds. Foreign enrolment is the
go-to category for that. This year saw, in particular, a significant
continued rise by Chinese students flocking to the US and other Western
countries, but it also saw the West forging numerous partnerships with
Chinese, Indian and African countries, as well as the rise of Asia as a
university ranking powerhouse. Many vice-chancellors also racked up some
regional air miles, with key partnerships being cemented among geographical
groupings of countries.

With cash-strapped governments trying to decide where they=92ll put their
funding, there are some victims: disciplines that fall under the social
sciences are seeing less support; some key professions, such as nuclear
engineering, are not seeing adequate numbers and even some important survey
data are making a country like Canada fumble for answers in a year where
shortages seemed to be an overriding theme. For this year=92s final edition
of University World News, PHILIP FINE gathered articles from our
correspondents that point to some significant trends in the world of
universities.

GLOBAL: Higher education and the financial crisis

Geoff Maslen
Higher education in many countries around the world has not suffered
significantly as a result of the global financial crisis, says a Unesco
report. But while universities may have escaped, the report also warns that
a 1% decline in economic growth rates of developing countries will push an
additional 20 million people into poverty and that up to two million more
children will die over the next five years who would not have perished had
the crisis not occurred.

ASIA: Academics look East as region seeks talent

Yojana Sharma
With the growth rate in higher education enrolments among the highest in
the world, expanding universities in the Asia-Pacific region have been
stepping up their search for academic talent. This year a number of Asian
countries launched or scaled up their overseas talent hunts, made easier by
education cutbacks in the West.

AFRICA: 2010 =96 A year for international initiatives

Karen MacGregor
For higher education in Africa, 2010 was notable for a flurry of
international initiatives, within the continent and between it and other
world regions. The year began, though, with the unfortunate ending of the
Partnership for Higher Education in Africa, an innovative decade-long
funding collaboration involving major US foundations.

GLOBAL: No rankings provide all the answers

Martin Ince*
According to the OECD, there are 150 million university students in the
world, and 3.3 million of them are studying outside their home country.
This means there is growing demand for information about universities on a
global scale. One approach to this challenge is university ranking.
