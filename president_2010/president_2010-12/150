UK: Coalition survives tuition fees rebellion

Brendan O=92Malley
Coalition proposals to allow tuition fees for universities in England to
rise to a maximum of =A39,000 (US$14,185), triple the existing level, to
compensate for an 80% cut in the teaching budget were passed after a stormy
House of Commons debate on Thursday night. But the government majority was
slashed to 21 as a reported majority of the 57 MPs in the junior coalition
party, the Liberal Democrats, abstained or voted against the measure.

AUSTRALIA: Majority of academics are casual

Geoff Maslen
 Casualisation of the Australian academic workforce has long been of

SPECIAL REPORT: e-Books in higher education
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although e-book readership is still tiny compared to paper books, it is
growing. University libraries and academic publishers can no longer ignore
the potential of digital books and have to cater for new ways to access
content. University World News takes a look at e-books and their
game-changing effect in higher education.

In a comprehensive overview of the sector JOSEPH TRYBLE believes India and
China could come to dominate the global education e-book market. But e-book
readership depends on widely available, cheap reading devices: ALYA MISHRA
gets behind the hype on a government-led project in India. It is also clear
that students will drive e-book acceptance but as ELYSHA KRUPP reports,
even in the US uptake is low. Perhaps more innovative ways to get e-books
to students is required: YOJANA SHARMA uncovers one way devised by a
British company. In a separate article she finds small university presses
being forced into major changes.

In a look at regional trends, KAREN MACGREGOR reports on an initiative
that started in Africa to deliver low cost e-books to universities in 27
developing countries. Correspondents in Scandinavia and the Arab world find
there is still a way to go for e-books to gain ground.

GLOBAL: China and India to dominate education e-books

With many different and high-priced digital reading devices coming on the
market in the West, and a need to gear digital content more closely to
students=92 needs, India and China could be front-runners in providing cheap
readers and academic content to the rest of the world, industry expert
JOSEPH TRYBLE believes.=20

INDIA: $35 laptop a revolution in university learning?

Alya Mishra
Cheap reading devices or laptops are a major issue in the spread of
e-books and other digital educational content in higher education. India
unveiled a prototype of a low-cost laptop in July initially for university
students. As more details emerge, sceptics wonder if the mass-produced
cheap laptop can live up to the education ministry=92s ambitions both in
terms of price, and in providing wider learning opportunities.

US: Despite the hype, e-textbook sales remain low

Elysha Krupp
=46rom the amount of attention the iPad, Kindle and other e-readers are
getting, it would seem that the majority of higher education students have
exchanged the printed word for its digital equivalent. But a recent study
by OnCampus Research, a division of the National Association of College
Stores, NACS, shows this is not the case. Some believe it is just a matter
of time before the true =91digital natives=92, now in high school, demand
e-books over print.

UK: What students really want =96 chapters, not books

reading material in smaller chunks.

GLOBAL: University presses join to face e-book future

universities, are becoming concerned about e-books =96 if they cannot keep =

with the changing digital landscape, many could well go broke.

AFRICA: Low-cost academic e-books project to scale up

Karen MacGregor
An initiative to deliver low-cost, high-quality digital publications to
universities in the developing world will scale up to serve 27 countries
worldwide, starting in Sub-Saharan Africa. Deals involving major discounts
have been reached with academic publishers, and pilot projects have run in
three countries. But it is not as simple as making resources available,
says Angus Scrimgeour of the International Association for Digital
Publications, IADP.

SCANDINAVIA: e-Book market uncertainty

Jan Petter Myklebust
In Norway, Sweden and Denmark, e-books are causing friction between
publishers, libraries and bookstores. Publishers are in a dilemma about
pricing and copyright protection. But libraries, students and academics
want access to more e-books. If Scandinavian publishers do not deliver in
time, customers will increasingly source their e-books abroad.

ARAB STATES: e-Books still at an early stage

Wagdy Sawahel
Arab states still have some way to go before e-books can catch on. But
with improvements in digital readiness in the region it is the production
of e-books and the expansion of e-book lending, particularly in online and
distance learning environments, which will determine the pace of e-book
adoption in higher education.

AFRICA: Open resources =96 what works on the continent

Jane Marshall

users of materials that originate elsewhere and are often irrelevant to

OER policy forum held in Paris this month.
