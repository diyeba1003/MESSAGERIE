AUSTRALIA: What skills for international students?

The mandatory inclusion of generic skills and attributes in policy
documents of Australian universities has attracted considerable debate and
controversy, writes ANNE CAMPBELL of the University of Canberra in the
latest edition of the Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management.
One neglected aspect is whether generic skills and attributes defined by
Western society are relevant for all students, including international
students returning to their home country after graduation, and whether
universities develop these skills.=20
