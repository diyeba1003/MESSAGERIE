SPECIAL REPORT: Shuffling the global higher education deck
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decisions by the British government to cut university funding and triple
the cap on tuition fees have sparked student protests, anger in England=92s
higher education sector and warnings that UK universities could lose
quality and global competitiveness. As the second most popular destination
in the world for international students, and a top research nation,
repercussions will also be felt internationally by students hoping to study
in England and academics involved in research and collaboration agreements
with English institutions.

In this Special Report, University World News gathers the views of
vice-chancellors around the world and of students on what the new policies
might mean for higher education in the UK and abroad. We also look at a
brain drain of French researchers to the US, Germany=92s efforts to attract
foreign students to fill skills gaps, a proposal for a Europe-wide loan
scheme aimed at increasing European student mobility, and student mobility
to and from America.

UK: Wrong time to raise fees, say global rivals

Brendan O=92Malley
How will plans to slash 40% of the teaching budget in England and allow
universities to raise tuition fees threefold affect the competitive edge of
UK universities globally? We asked university leaders around the world to
tell us what they think. Some of them conclude that the UK is at a critical
tipping point.

alternatives in the event of a three-fold increase in the cap on tuition
fees proposed by the coalition government and deep cuts to the teaching
budget.

COMMENTARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

GLOBAL: Partnerships thrive on exchange of values

James DeVaney*
As experimentation continues we are seeing an unprecedented number and
range of types of global partnerships and educational ventures. But despite
the enthusiasm for global expansion, questions about the sustainability of
some branch campus models have not yet been answered. To succeed, globally
engaged universities must acknowledge the needs of their host communities
and communities must acknowledge that foreign universities have their own
set of expectations and needs. Regardless of form, mutual value exchange
will remain at the core of sustainable partnerships.
