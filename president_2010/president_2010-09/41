COMMENTARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

US: Act brings in much-needed textbook competition

Frances Woolley*
Economics textbooks extol the virtues of competition. However the market
for textbooks is anything but competitive. A professor typically requires
students to buy a specific textbook. Even if that text is available from
sellers such as amazon.com, students may not discover which books are
required until the first day of classes, by which time it is too late to
get the best on-line deals. The US Higher Education Opportunity Act is
trying to change that.

DUBAI: Regulation is not the only challenge

James DeVaney
A call for tighter regulation of international branch campuses in Dubai=92s
free zones hit the headlines last week. In a Dubai School of Government
policy brief, Jason Lane of the State University of New York says patchwork
regulation has encouraged significant duplication of degree offerings,
concern about the quality of some programmes and could damage the emirate=

GLOBAL: Disaster lessons unheeded

Geoff Maslen
International aid agencies have failed to learn the lessons of the 2004
tsunami and may be repeating their mistakes in Haiti, and even in Pakistan
as that country recovers from the disastrous floods, say researchers at
RMIT University in Melbourne. After the world=92s first thorough
investigation into what is needed to rebuild viable communities following a
major natural disaster, the researchers concluded that international aid
agencies will continue to waste aid money and make avoidable mistakes in
new disaster situations.
