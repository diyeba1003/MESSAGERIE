This week=92s highlights
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week=92s edition of University World News publishes a special report on
exporting online education, edited by PHILIP FINE, and JOHN WALSHE reports
from a European Universities Association conference in Bologna on
diversifying university income streams. In the Commentary section RICHARD
HOLMES probes a flawed indicator in the Times Higher Education world
university rankings, and in Features DAVID JOBBINS reports on first
official history of the British intelligence service MI6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL REPORT: Exporting online education
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Online education. It can bring high profits or require large subsidies. It
can educate those in far-flung regions, give hope to working-class
ambitions and act as a development tool. On the other hand, it can feel
isolating, cheapen a university=92s name and over-commodify a professor=92s
role. It can be run by faceless corporations or be part of an integrated
plan for a country=92s growing needs. There are lots of stories to be told.

In this special report, ALYA MISHRA in India shows how online education is
being used to shore up domestic shortfalls in bricks-and-mortar
universities, with entrepreneurs eyeing the export market. SARAH KING HEAD
looks at the high profits of US online education providers, who seem to be
straining the student loan system, and how universities are lining up to
court the for-profits. Profit margins are lower in Africa, writes SHARON
DELL, with one South African university cornering the market at a loss, to
try and bring more higher education to the continent. EILEEN TRAVERS=92
article details a Mexican programme that brings online courses to ex-pats
in an effort to build its roster of well-trained professionals.=20

Bringing this all together is DAVID JOBBINS=92 exclusive interview with
online and distance education pioneer Sir John Daniel, who heads up the
Commonwealth of Learning, looking among other things at changing attitudes
toward the sector and the good it can offer developing countries. Next week
JOHN RICHARD SCHROCK reports that some US universities have begun to reject
online courses on transcripts of student applicants.

Philip Fine
Editor of the Special Report on exporting online education


INDIA: Local need feeds online education investment

Alya Mishra
While Western countries look at exporting education online, India is using
that platform to fill a shortage of bricks-and-mortar universities. Keen to
increase the enrolment of 18-to-30 year olds from a dismal 12.4% to an
ambitious 30%, India is investing heavily in information technology
believing it will encourage online education and increase student numbers.

US: High profits mean online providers here to stay

Sarah King Head=20
A cancellation of a large online project between the California community
college system and Kaplan University reflects a dilemma faced by higher
education in the US: many contact universities rely on for-profit online
providers to train the masses.=20

AFRICA: Going where for-profits dare not tread

Sharon Dell
Exporting online higher education to the African continent is not for the
faint of heart. It=92s a complicated and costly affair, which means that
for-profit operators have tended shy away from it. One university seems to
have cornered the African market in providing distance and online
post-school education, with the help of some political goodwill at the
highest levels of government. The huge University of South Africa, Unisa,
has brought a developmental vision to Sub-Saharan Africa, embracing the
continent and earning a solid reputation in the process.=20

GLOBAL: Q&A with on-line pioneer John Daniel

David Jobbins
Sir John Daniel has been at the leading edge of the open and distance
learning (ODL) movement through his roles as Vice-chancellor of the UK=92s
Open University, Assistant Director General of UNESCO and, currently,
President of the Commonwealth of Learning in Vancouver, Canada, an
organisation that has set the standard for ODL in developing countries.
Among the many projects it supports is Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan
Africa, TESSA, whose open educational materials were used by 300,000
African teachers last year.

In a bid to encourage transparency and stamp out corruption and fraud in

parents and students that private providers were engaging in malpractices

to explain the expenditure when they appeared before a parliamentary

UK: Economy needs more graduates, says think tank

David Jobbins
A report by a leading UK think tank calls on the coalition government to
increase rather than to restrict the production of university graduates to
meet long-term economic needs. The Work Foundation accepts that the only
way to finance continued growth in graduate supply is to increase tuition
fees =96 but in a way that safeguards and maximises access to higher
education.

European Universities Association conference
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Less state money means more regulation, was the view expressed by many
delegates at a recent European Universities Association conference in
Bologna on diversifying income streams. They heard several examples of how
universities are successfully tapping other sources of revenue but were
also cautioned about the potential pitfalls of cosying up too close to the
private sector.

EUROPE: Less government money but more regulation

John Walshe
Universities across Europe face a future of reduced state funding with a
greater degree of government regulation, a European Universities
Association conference on its European Universities Diversifying Income
Stream (EUDIS) project, heard.

EUROPE: Universities warned of funding risk to mission

John Walshe
Too great a hunger for external funds may distract universities from their
mission and focus, the European Universities Association conference in
Bologna was warned. Over-dependence on the private sector can also result
in too much application-focussed research at the cost of fundamental and
curiosity-driven research.

lag behind in terms of key OECD criteria.
